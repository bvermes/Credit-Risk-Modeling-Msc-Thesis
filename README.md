# Credit-Risk-Modeling-Msc-Thesis
This repository is created to present my masters thesis

## Goal
The goal of my thesis is to design and implement predictive models that can
effectively calculate expected losses for a financial institution, thus helping to provision
and avoid loans with negative profit. The two main pillars of expected loss are the
probability of default (PD) and the loss given default (LGD). The thesis will present the
complete development process of both models, providing insights into research in the
field and use the lessons learned for the design and the implementation of my own
modeling process.


To achieve this, I have defined the tasks to be solved and the methodology for the solution process. For each tasks, I have researched the related work in the field and used the lessons learned in my own solution. 
I have placed great emphasis on presenting the considerations and have tried to present this less well known area of modelling in a comprehensive way.
Particular attention has been paid to ensuring data quality.
I have carried out several data cleaning processes, dedicated for each modelling procedure.
Then, for different algorithms, separate data sets were created for the corresponding the training set with the appropriate transformations.
My goal was to use algorithms that are interpretable. I examined the results obtained from several points of view and did new iterations if necessary. The end result was a system, in which the start-up of the modelling procedures is fast, easy to configure and reusable. The result is stable, well-explained, marketable models and the positive financial implications of putting them into operation were calculated supported by cost-benefit calculations.
For me, going through the whole process was very instructive and I feel that, I have learned more data-related fields.
