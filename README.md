# Credit-Risk-Modeling-Msc-Thesis
This repository is created to present my masters thesis

## Goal
The goal of my thesis is to design and implement predictive models that can
effectively calculate expected losses for a financial institution, thus helping to provision
and avoid loans with negative profit. The two main pillars of expected loss are the
probability of default (PD) and the loss given default (LGD). The thesis will present the
complete development process of both models, providing insights into research in the
field and use the lessons learned for the design and the implementation of my own
modeling process.


To achieve this, I defined the tasks to be solved and the methodology for the solution process. For each task, I researched related work in the field and applied the lessons learned to my own solution. I emphasized presenting the considerations comprehensively to shed light on this lesser-known area of modeling.

Particular attention was paid to ensuring data quality. I conducted several data cleaning processes specific to each modeling procedure. Then, for different algorithms, I created separate datasets for the corresponding training sets with appropriate transformations.

My goal was to use interpretable algorithms. I examined the results from several perspectives and conducted new iterations as necessary. The end result is a system where the start-up of modeling procedures is fast, easy to configure, and reusable. The result is stable, well-explained, marketable models, with the positive financial implications of their implementation supported by cost-benefit calculations.

For me, going through the whole process was very instructive, and I feel that I have expanded my knowledge in various data-related fields.
